# OTPField

One-time password input coordination across multiple visible cells and one hidden form value.

## When to Use

Use OTPField for a short verification code that is entered one character at a
time and may be pasted from a message. Use PasswordToggleField for a reusable
secret chosen by the person, and Input when the value belongs in one normal
text box instead of visually separated cells.

## Features

- Controlled and uncontrolled full value.
- Coordinates rendered input cells and assigns indexes from their render order.
- Optional explicit input indexes.
- Roving tab stop so the field behaves as one logical control.
- Paste distribution across cells.
- Arrow, Backspace, Delete, Home, and End navigation.
- Numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, or custom pattern filtering.
- Hidden input for native form submission.
- Optional masking, completion callback, auto-focus, and form submission.

## Import

```tsx
import { OTPField } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
<OTPField.Root>
  <OTPField.Input />
  <OTPField.Separator />
  <OTPField.Input />
</OTPField.Root>
```

### Input

Renders one visible character cell, joins the roving tab stop, and delegates
typing, paste, deletion, and focus movement to `Root`.

| `[data-disabled]` | Present when disabled |
| `[data-readonly]` | Present when read-only |
| `[data-invalid]` | Present when invalid |

### Separator

Decorative separator between cells.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"otp-field-separator"` |
| `[data-index]` | Value from `index` when provided |

The package exports `useOTPFieldContext` and its provider for advanced compound
parts. It also exports `getOTPFieldPattern`, `isOTPFieldCharAccepted`,
`getOTPFieldChars`, `filterOTPFieldValue`, and `getOTPFieldDisplayChar` for
using the same filtering and display rules outside the rendered field.

## Examples

### Six Digit Code

```tsx
import { OTPField } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

export function VerificationCode() {
  return (
    <OTPField.Root name="code" length={6}>
      {Array.from({ length: 6 }, (_, index) => (
        <OTPField.Input key={index} />
      ))}
    </OTPField.Root>
  );
}
```

### Grouped Code

```tsx
import { OTPField } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

export function GroupedCode() {
  return (
    <OTPField.Root length={6} onComplete={(code) => console.log(code)}>
      <OTPField.Input />
      <OTPField.Input />
      <OTPField.Input />
      <OTPField.Separator>-</OTPField.Separator>
      <OTPField.Input />
      <OTPField.Input />
      <OTPField.Input />
    </OTPField.Root>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

The first visible cell owns required validity and `aria-required` for the logical OTP value; the
combined named input remains submission-only. A validation attempt is mirrored
across Root and every cell. Inline behavior suppresses the browser bubble.

The root uses `role="group"` and the visible inputs use roving `tabIndex`, so
Tab enters the OTP field once. Each input receives a generated position label,
and the separator is hidden from assistive technology. The group does not carry
`aria-required`, because that attribute is unsupported on `role="group"`. Give the group a clear
label through native `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` or Field. The first visible
cell owns required validity and anchors native browser feedback. The combined
hidden native input is submission-only;
uncontrolled content resets to `defaultValue`.

Use `getInputLabel` to localize every generated cell position label. A direct
`aria-label` on an Input still overrides the generated label for that cell.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` | Enters or leaves the OTP field as one logical control. |
| `ArrowRight` | Moves to the next cell. |
| `ArrowLeft` | Moves to the previous cell. |
| `Home` | Moves to the first cell. |
| `End` | Moves to the last cell. |
| `Backspace` | Clears the current cell or moves backward when empty. |
| `Delete` | Clears the current cell. |
| `Paste` | Distributes accepted characters across cells. |
