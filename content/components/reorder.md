# Reorder

Headless primitives for manually arranging one controlled linear collection.
`Reorder` composes `DragDrop` with ordered-list semantics, identity-array
updates, keyboard movement, and direct single-activation movement controls.

## When to Use

Use `Reorder` when a person decides and saves the order of items in one list.
Do not use it for automatic sorting by name, date, or status. Tables, trees,
Kanban boards, and movement between containers need component-specific APIs
that may reuse `DragDrop` internally.

## Features

- Controlled stable-identity order.
- Native ordered-list and list-item defaults.
- Mouse, pen, delayed-touch, and keyboard reordering.
- Direct move before, after, to start, and to end controls.
- Localizable instructions and live announcements.
- Disabled, read-only, per-item disabled, vertical, horizontal, and RTL modes.
- Drop-position state for styled layers without Atom-owned visuals.

## Import

```tsx
import { Reorder } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
<Reorder.Root>
  <Reorder.Item>
    <Reorder.Handle />
    <Reorder.MoveBefore />
    <Reorder.MoveAfter />
    <Reorder.MoveToStart />
    <Reorder.MoveToEnd />
    <Reorder.DropIndicator />
  </Reorder.Item>
</Reorder.Root>
```

## API Reference

### Root

Owns the controlled identity order and renders an `ol` by default.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `string[]` | required |
| `onItemsChange` | `(items, details) => void` | required |
| `getItemLabel` | `(value) => string` | required |
| `orientation` | `"vertical" \| "horizontal"` | `"vertical"` |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `instructions` | `string` | English keyboard instructions |
| `messages` | `DragDropMessages` | English defaults |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"reorder"` |
| `[data-orientation]` | `"vertical"` or `"horizontal"` |
| `[data-disabled]` | Present when disabled |
| `[data-readonly]` | Present when read-only |

`onItemsChange` details include `activeValue`, `overValue`, `position`,
`previousIndex`, `nextIndex`, and `input` (`keyboard`, `pointer`, or `control`).

### Item

Registers one stable identity and renders an `li` by default.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `string` | required |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"reorder-item"` |
| `[data-value]` | Item identity |
| `[data-dragging]` | Present while active |
| `[data-drop-target]` | Present while targeted |
| `[data-drop-position]` | `"before"` or `"after"` while targeted |
| `[data-disabled]` | Present when disabled |

### Handle

Native button that starts and controls dragging. It must receive an accessible
name such as `Move Verify production`.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| ARIA attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-describedby` | Generated instruction ID |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"reorder-handle"` |
| `[data-dragging]` | Present while active |

### MoveBefore

Native button that immediately moves the Item one logical position earlier.
It disables at the first boundary.

### MoveAfter

Native button that immediately moves the Item one logical position later. It
disables at the last boundary.

### MoveToStart

Native button that immediately moves the Item to the first position.

### MoveToEnd

Native button that immediately moves the Item to the last position.

All movement buttons accept native button props, `asChild`, `render`, and
consumer content. They emit `[data-slot]` and `[data-move]`, and require an
authored accessible name.

### DropIndicator

Decorative `span` that exposes the proposed insertion position.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| ARIA attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-hidden` | `true` |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"reorder-drop-indicator"` |
| `[data-state]` | `"active"` or `"inactive"` |
| `[data-position]` | `"before"` or `"after"` while active |

## Examples

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Reorder } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

const labels: Record<string, string> = {
  verify: "Verify production",
  approve: "Request approval",
  deploy: "Deploy release",
};

export function ReorderExample() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(["verify", "approve", "deploy"]);

  return (
    <Reorder.Root
      items={items}
      getItemLabel={(value) => labels[value] ?? value}
      onItemsChange={(nextItems) => setItems(nextItems)}
    >
      {items.map((value) => (
        <Reorder.Item key={value} value={value}>
          <Reorder.Handle aria-label={`Move ${labels[value]}`}>
            Move
          </Reorder.Handle>
          <span>{labels[value]}</span>
          <Reorder.MoveBefore aria-label={`Move ${labels[value]} up`}>Up</Reorder.MoveBefore>
          <Reorder.MoveAfter aria-label={`Move ${labels[value]} down`}>Down</Reorder.MoveAfter>
          <Reorder.DropIndicator />
        </Reorder.Item>
      ))}
    </Reorder.Root>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

`Root` and `Item` use native ordered-list semantics. Handles and movement
operations are native buttons. The handle receives generated instructions and
Root announces movement with human labels and one-based positions. Keep
movement buttons visibly available: they are the simple-pointer alternative
required by [WCAG 2.2 Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements).

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Picks up from a Handle; commits while active. |
| `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` | Moves within a vertical list. |
| `Arrow Left` / `Arrow Right` | Moves within a horizontal list and mirrors in RTL. |
| `Home` / `End` | Moves to the first or last position. |
| `Escape` | Cancels without changing the identity order. |

Use stable record IDs as `value`, render Items in the exact order supplied to
Root, and preserve those keys after updates so focus remains on the moved
control. Applications own persistence, Undo, failures, and conflicts.
