# HoverCard

Headless hover-and-focus preview primitives with delayed disclosure and floating
positioning.

## When to Use

Use HoverCard for supplemental, nonessential preview content such as a short
profile summary. Use Tooltip for a brief label, Popover for content with
buttons or other interaction, and Dialog for a task that must hold focus.
HoverCard closes when focus leaves and does not create a dialog or popover
accessibility relationship, so never put required actions inside it.

## Features

- Supports controlled and uncontrolled open state.
- Opens from mouse-capable pointer hover and focus-visible Trigger interaction;
  touch input and its browser-generated compatibility events do not open the
  preview or replace the Trigger's native action.
- Does not install hover disclosure on touch-only devices and updates that
  capability when the browser's available input devices change.
- Uses configurable open and close delays and a safe pointer corridor that keeps
  Content open while the pointer crosses the gap from Trigger to Content.
- Positions Content by trying alternate alignments on the requested side,
  repeating them on the opposite side, and using perpendicular sides only as
  final fallbacks; collision shift and Arrow coordinates follow the result.
- Supports inline or custom-container portals.
- Participates in topmost-layer Escape dismissal.

## API Reference

### Root

Owns delayed open state and renders no wrapper.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` | `boolean` | - |
| `defaultOpen` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean) => void` | - |
| `openDelay` | `number` | `700` |
| `closeDelay` | `number` | `300` |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` |

### Trigger

Provides the positioning reference and mouse-capable hover/focus events. It
renders a focusable `span` by default. With `asChild`, the child keeps its own
tab order and native touch behavior.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"hover-card-trigger"` |
| `[data-state]` | `"open" \| "closed"` |

Trigger emits no `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, or dialog/popover role.
Disabled Root prevents opening and removes the default Trigger from the Tab
order, but Trigger emits no disabled ARIA or data attribute.

### Portal

Moves Content to `document.body` by default without a wrapper.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container` | `Element \| DocumentFragment \| null` | `document.body` |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` |

### Content

Renders a positioned generic `div`. It has no owned landmark or popup role;
`ariaLabel` is passed as `aria-label` but does not create a Trigger relationship.
Content exposes measured `--atom-floating-available-width` and
`--atom-floating-available-height` properties.
Portalled Content preserves an explicit `dir`; otherwise it resolves direction
from Trigger and then `Direction.Provider`.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `side` | `"top" \| "right" \| "bottom" \| "left"` | `"bottom"` |
| `align` | `"start" \| "center" \| "end"` | `"center"` |
| `sideOffset` | `number` | `8` |
| `ariaLabel` | `string` | - |

| ARIA attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-label` | Value from `ariaLabel` |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"hover-card-content"` |
| `[data-state]` | `"open" \| "closed"` |
| `[data-side]` | Resolved side after collision handling |
| `[data-positioned]` | Present after positioning |

### Arrow

Renders a decorative SVG aligned to Content's resolved side. Custom children
replace its default polygon.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | `number` | `10` |
| `height` | `number` | `5` |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Default polygon |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| ARIA attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-hidden` | `"true"` |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"hover-card-arrow"` |
| `[data-side]` | Resolved Content side |

### getHoverCardArrowGeometry

Returns SVG dimensions, outward size, and polygon points for a side, width,
and height. This is useful when building a compatible custom Arrow.

The entry point also exports `useHoverCardContext` and
`useHoverCardContentContext` for advanced custom parts. Both throw outside
their required Root or Content provider.

## Examples

### Profile Preview

```tsx
import { HoverCard } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

export function ProfilePreview() {
  return (
    <HoverCard.Root>
      <HoverCard.Trigger asChild>
        <a href="/people/ada">Ada Lovelace</a>
      </HoverCard.Trigger>
      <HoverCard.Portal>
        <HoverCard.Content>
          <HoverCard.Arrow />
          <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
          <p>Mathematician and early computing author.</p>
        </HoverCard.Content>
      </HoverCard.Portal>
    </HoverCard.Root>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

HoverCard has no standalone WAI-ARIA popup pattern. Trigger remains the
semantic element supplied by the consumer, Content is supplemental document
content, and Arrow is hidden from assistive technology. The preview must not be
the only place important information or actions are available. Touch does not
open HoverCard, so a Trigger link keeps its normal tap and long-press behavior.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Focus-visible entry can open Trigger; leaving closes after `closeDelay`. |
| `Escape` | Closes the topmost open HoverCard immediately. |

## Changelog

### 0.6.9

- Preserved resolved Trigger or provider direction on portalled Content while
  retaining explicit Content `dir` precedence.

### 0.6.8

- Exposed measured available dimensions through headless floating properties
  for constrained styled surfaces.

### 0.6.6

- Disabled hover interaction when the browser reports no hover-capable input
  and captured touch pointer entry before native compatibility mouse events on
  hybrid devices.

### 0.6.5

- Added a short post-touch compatibility-event guard so intermittent Safari
  mouse and focus synthesis cannot open HoverCard after touch activation.

### 0.6.4

- Limited hover disclosure to mouse-capable pointers so touch keeps the
  Trigger's native tap and long-press behavior.
- Added a safe geometric corridor from Trigger to Content and prevented
  exit-retained Content from reopening itself during its closing motion.

### 0.6.3

- Prioritized every usable alignment on the requested side, followed by the
  opposite side, before allowing perpendicular-axis collision fallbacks.

### 0.6.2

- Added perpendicular-side collision fallbacks after the preferred and opposite
  sides, preventing wide previews from remaining cropped on a constrained axis.

### 0.3.1

- Fixed exit-presence cleanup so closed HoverCard Content unmounts after its
  CSS motion window even when no end event is emitted.

### 0.2.0

- Fixed HoverCard render/default trigger positioning by updating Floating UI
  after the trigger ref commits.
- Made default and `render` HoverCard triggers keyboard focusable while keeping
  opening scoped to hover and focus-visible interactions.
- Added shared dismissable layer Escape handling so HoverCard participates in
  topmost-layer dismissal with other overlays.

### 0.1.0

- Initial Atom release.
