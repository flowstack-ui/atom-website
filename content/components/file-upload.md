# FileUpload

Headless native file-picker, dropzone, validation, selected-file collection,
and removal primitives.

## When to Use

Use FileUpload when users must choose local files and the interface needs a
custom picker, drop target, selected-file list, or client-side feedback. Use a
plain `input type="file"` when the browser control is sufficient. Client checks
improve feedback but are not a security boundary; validate every uploaded file
again on the server.

## Features

- Supports controlled and uncontrolled file arrays.
- Uses a hidden native file input for picker and form semantics.
- Supports button and drag-and-drop selection.
- Validates accept rules, count, size, and custom errors.
- Appends or replaces multiple-file selections.
- Exposes rejected files, drag state, item metadata, and removal actions.
- Integrates IDs, descriptions, and state with Field.

## Import

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

## API Reference

### Root

Renders a `div`, owns selection and validation state, and supplies behavior to
all parts. Local field-state props override Field context.
An uncancelled native form reset restores uncontrolled `defaultFiles`, clears
rejections and drag state, and resets the native file picker.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `files` | `File[]` | - |
| `defaultFiles` | `File[]` | `[]` |
| `onFilesChange` | `(files: File[]) => void` | - |
| `onRejectedFilesChange` | `(files: FileUploadRejectedFile[]) => void` | - |
| `accept` | `string` | - |
| `multiple` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `appendFiles` | `boolean` | `true` when multiple |
| `maxFiles` | `number` | `1` when single; otherwise - |
| `maxSize` | `number` | - |
| `validateFile` | `(file) => string \| null \| undefined \| false` | - |
| `preventDocumentDrop` | `boolean` | `true` |
| `name` | `string` | - |
| `form` | `string` | - |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Field state or `false` |
| `required` | `boolean` | Field state or `false` |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | Field state or `false` |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload"` |
| `[data-state]` | `"filled" \| "empty"` |
| `[data-drag]` | `"idle" \| "accept" \| "reject"` |
| `[data-filled]` | Present with selected files |
| `[data-rejected]` | Present with rejected files |
| `[data-disabled]` | Present when disabled |
| `[data-readonly]` | Present when read only |
| `[data-required]` | Present when required |
| `[data-invalid]` | Present when invalid |

### HiddenInput

Renders the transparent native `input type="file"`, opens through Trigger, and
sends selected `FileList` values into Root validation. It is aligned with
Trigger so native required feedback points to the visible control and redirects
validation focus there. Accepted drag/drop files are synchronized back to the
native input when the browser permits `FileList` assignment.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `onChange` | `ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>` | - |

| ARIA/native attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Field control ID or generated Root control ID |
| `name`, `form`, `accept`, `multiple` | Root values |
| `disabled`, `required` | Resolved Root/Field state |
| `aria-describedby` | Explicit Root value or Field message IDs |
| `aria-invalid` | Resolved invalid state |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-hidden-input"` |

### Trigger

Opens HiddenInput's native file picker. It renders a button by default and adds
button semantics to non-native custom elements. Inside Field, its accessible
name combines the Field label with its authored action text, and it receives
the Field description/error and invalid state. Explicit native ARIA naming and
description props override those defaults.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| ARIA attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | `"button"` for non-native custom elements |
| `aria-disabled` | `"true"` when a custom trigger is disabled or read-only |
| `aria-labelledby` | Field label plus Trigger text when no explicit accessible name is supplied |
| `aria-describedby` | Explicit value or Field description/error IDs |
| `aria-invalid` | `"true"` when Root or Field is invalid |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-trigger"` |
| `[data-disabled]` | Present when Root is disabled |
| `[data-readonly]` | Present when Root is read-only |
| `[data-required]` | Present when Root or Field is required |
| `[data-invalid]` | Present when Root or Field is invalid |

### Dropzone

Renders a `div` that accepts dropped files. It owns drag events but adds no
button role or tab stop; include Trigger when keyboard picker access is needed.
Drag state is validated against the same type, count, size, and custom rules as
the eventual drop. Root prevents file drops on the surrounding document by
default so an accidental outside drop does not replace the current page;
`preventDocumentDrop={false}` opts out without affecting non-file drag/drop.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-dropzone"` |
| `[data-drag]` | `"idle" \| "accept" \| "reject"` |
| `[data-dragging]` | Present for accept/reject drag state |
| `[data-accepted]` | Present for accepted drag state |
| `[data-rejected]` | Present for rejected drag state |
| `[data-disabled]` | Present when disabled |
| `[data-readonly]` | Present when read-only |

### ItemGroup

Renders a `ul` for selected files. A function child receives each `(file,
index)`; function children cannot be combined with `asChild`.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode \| ((file, index) => ReactNode)` | - |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-item-group"` |
| `[data-count]` | Selected file count |
| `[data-filled]` | Present when count is greater than zero |

### Item

Renders one `li` and provides its resolved File and index to metadata/removal
parts. It returns `null` when neither `file` nor the requested Root index exists.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | `File` | Root file at `index` |
| `index` | `number` | `0` |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-item"` |
| `[data-index]` | Resolved file index |
| `[data-name]` | File name |
| `[data-size]` | File size in bytes |

### ItemName

Renders a `span` containing the File name by default. Consumer children replace
that text; `asChild` and `render` are supported.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Current file name |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-item-name"` |

### ItemSize

Renders a `span` containing `formatFileSize(file.size)` by default. Consumer
children replace the formatted text; `asChild` and `render` are supported.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Formatted current file size |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-item-size"` |
| `[data-size]` | File size in bytes |

### ItemDeleteTrigger

Renders a button that removes the current Item, resets the native input so the
same file can be chosen again, and respects disabled/read-only state.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `render` | `RenderProp` | - |

| ARIA attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-label` | Consumer value or `"Remove {file.name}"` |

| Data attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `[data-slot]` | `"file-upload-item-delete-trigger"` |
| `[data-disabled]` | Present when disabled |
| `[data-readonly]` | Present when read-only |

### fileMatchesAccept

Returns whether a File matches a comma-separated extension, exact MIME type,
or wildcard MIME rule. No rule or an empty rule accepts the file.

### validateFileUploadFiles

Returns `{ acceptedFiles, rejectedFiles }`. Rejection errors contain `"type"`,
`"size"`, `"count"`, and any nonempty custom validation string.

### formatFileSize

Formats bytes with binary-sized B, KB, MB, GB, or TB units and returns `"0 B"`
for non-finite or nonpositive input.

The entry also exports `useFileUploadContext` and `useFileUploadItemContext` for
advanced custom parts; both require their corresponding parent.

## Examples

### Multiple Documents

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

export function DocumentUpload() {
  return (
    <FileUpload.Root name="documents" accept=".pdf,.txt" multiple maxFiles={5}>
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose documents</FileUpload.Trigger>
      <FileUpload.Dropzone>Drop PDF or text files here</FileUpload.Dropzone>
      <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
        {(file, index) => (
          <FileUpload.Item key={`${file.name}-${index}`} file={file}>
            <FileUpload.ItemName />
            <FileUpload.ItemSize />
            <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>Remove</FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger>
          </FileUpload.Item>
        )}
      </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    </FileUpload.Root>
  );
}
```

### Report Rejections

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { FileUpload, type FileUploadRejectedFile } from "@flowstack-ui/atom";

export function ImageUpload() {
  const [rejected, setRejected] = useState<FileUploadRejectedFile[]>([]);
  return (
    <FileUpload.Root
      accept="image/*"
      maxSize={2 * 1024 * 1024}
      onRejectedFilesChange={setRejected}
    >
      <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
      <FileUpload.Trigger>Choose image</FileUpload.Trigger>
      <p aria-live="polite">
        {rejected.length > 0 ? "The selected image was not accepted." : ""}
      </p>
    </FileUpload.Root>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

HiddenInput remains an aligned native file control and owns its constraints.
A validation attempt is mirrored to Root, Trigger, and Field. Inline behavior
suppresses the browser bubble; native behavior keeps it at Trigger's bounds.
The visible Trigger carries the Field label, description/error, and invalid
relationships while preserving its own action wording. Drag/drop is optional;
always include a Trigger for keyboard, touch, and single-pointer selection.

HiddenInput supplies native file-input semantics and must be present for
Trigger to open a picker. Give the upload a visible Field.Label or another
accessible name. Trigger and ItemDeleteTrigger use button keyboard behavior;
Dropzone alone is pointer-only. Announce rejection feedback in visible text and
validate file type, size, and content again on the server.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Opens the picker from Trigger or removes from ItemDeleteTrigger. |

## Changelog

### 0.19.7

- Related the visible Trigger to its Field label, description/error, required,

### 0.6.12

- Aligned the native file input with Trigger for required feedback and
  synchronized accepted files after picker and drag/drop updates.

### 0.5.0
